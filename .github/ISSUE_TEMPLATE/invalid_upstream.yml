        ‚ö†Ô∏è **STOP. READ BEFORE CONTINUING.**

        This repository is a **preconfigured packaging project**.
        It does **not** develop or maintain the tools included in the AIO package.

        ‚ùå If your issue is about:
        - App crashes (Goldleaf, DBI, EdiZon, JKSV, etc.)
        - Cheats not working
        - Overclocking issues
        - Controller problems
        - Missing features in an included application

        üëâ You are in the **wrong place**. Please report it to the upstream project responsible for that tool.

        ‚úÖ You *should* use this issue form if:
        - A tool is missing from the release package
        - Files are in the wrong folder or don't load correctly
        - The ZIP release is broken or incomplete
        - Something in the AIO setup or instructions is clearly incorrect

        We reserve the right to close irrelevant issues without reply. Thank you for understanding.
